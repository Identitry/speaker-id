"""Centroid maintenance helpers.

This module provides utilities to (re)compute the perâ€‘user "master" embeddings
stored in the `speakers_master` collection. A master embedding is simply the
centroid (arithmetic mean) of all raw enrollment vectors for a user.

Why centroids?
--------------
Using a centroid per user keeps the online identification path fast: we search
against one vector per user instead of many raw clips. Rebuilding centroids
periodically (or incrementally at enroll time) lets the representation drift
with new audio while remaining robust to outliers.

        Number of users for which a centroid was (re)computed. Users without
        any raw clips will yield 0 from `rebuild_master_for` and do not count
        toward the total.

    Notes
    -----
    - This function operates on the list of names *already* present in the
      MASTER collection. If you want to include users who only have raw clips
      but no master yet, add a pass over `speakers_raw` to collect names.
    - Intended for admin/maintenance tasks (e.g., a nightly job) rather than
      per-request use.
