"""Application lifecycle hooks (startup/shutdown).

FastAPI allows registering callables that run on application startup and
shutdown. We keep these hooks minimal and sideâ€‘effect free so they complete
quickly and make readiness/liveness probes happy.

Current responsibilities
------------------------
- on_startup: ensure Qdrant collections exist before the first request.
- on_shutdown: emit a clean shutdown log message (placeholder for future cleanup).

If you later add background tasks (e.g., periodic centroid rebuilds, metrics
exporters), this is a good place to initialize and tear them down cleanly.
