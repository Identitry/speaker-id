# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We pledge to make participation in our project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

###  Do These Things

- **Be excellent to each other** - Remember, we're all here because we think voice recognition is cool
- **Use welcoming and inclusive language** - Even when debating whether ECAPA is worth the extra RAM
- **Be respectful of differing opinions** - Yes, even those who think 0.70 is an acceptable threshold
- **Accept constructive criticism gracefully** - Your first PR probably has a few bugs (ours did too)
- **Focus on what's best for the community** - Not just what makes your specific use case work
- **Show empathy** - That person asking "why doesn't it work?" at 2 AM has probably been debugging for hours

### L Don't Do These Things

- **No trolling or insulting comments** - Save your sass for your commit messages
- **No personal or political attacks** - We're here for speaker IDs, not political IDs
- **No harassment, public or private** - Don't be that person
- **No publishing others' private information** - Unless you want lawyers involved
- **No conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate** - If you have to ask "is this okay?", it probably isn't

## Enforcement

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards. We have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that don't align with this Code of Conduct.

**In other words**: We'll try to be understanding, but we also won't hesitate to show you the door if you're consistently making the community worse.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it by opening an issue or contacting the project maintainers directly.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. We are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/), version 2.1, with a sprinkle of humor because life's too short to be serious all the time.

**TL;DR**: Be nice, be respectful, don't be a jerk. It's really that simple. <¤
